    abstract = {The kinetic mechanisms describing the combustion of longer-chain
                fuels often have limited applicability due to the high number of
                species involved in their pyrolysis and oxidation paths. In this
                work, this is addressed for what concerns oxymethylene ethers ({
                OMEn}), which recently emerged as synthetic fuel candidates for
                diesel applications. Starting from an established mechanism
                representing the pyrolysis and oxidation of dimethoxymethane {DMM
                } or {OME}1, the combustion chemistry of heavier {OMEs} up to {
                OME}5 was developed by relying on reaction classes, where
                structural isomers were lumped into pseudospecies, and the
                related rates assigned according to analogy and rate rules,
                considering {OME}1 and its lumped chemistry as reference. The
                obtained lumped model was then coupled to a data-driven
                optimization methodology, still based on reaction classes, where
                the consistency among the {OME}2-5 submodules was preserved
                through scaling factors previously defined. Such a combined
                approach proved particularly effective in delivering a compact
                kinetic mechanism, requiring only 48 species on top of the {OME}1
                model for its extension up to {OME}5. The extensive validation
                and analysis of model predictions show the successful capability
                of the lumped formulation in representing the chemical behavior
                of the whole {OME} family, and the effectiveness of the
                optimization procedure in further improving model predictions
                throughout most of the operating space and target properties
                (ignition delay times in shock tubes, laminar flame speeds,
                speciations in stirred and flow reactors). The successful
                implementation of this workflow paves the way for its extensive
                use for the kinetic modeling of even heavier fuels and its
                coupling with skeletal reduction techniques to further reduce
                their size to affordable levels for {CFD} applications.},

    abstract = {The kinetic mechanisms describing the combustion of longer-chain
                fuels often have limited applicability due to the high number of
                species involved in their oxidation and decomposition paths. This
                work proposes a combined methodology for developing compact but
                accurate kinetic mechanisms of these fuels and applies it to
                dimethoxymethane (DMM), or oxymethylene ether 1 (OME1). An
                automatic chemical lumping procedure, performed by grouping
                structural isomers into pseudospecies, was proposed and applied
                to a detailed kinetic model of DMM pyrolysis and oxidation, built
                from state-of-the-art kinetic sub-models. Such a methodology
                proved particularly efficient in delivering a compact kinetic
                mechanism, requiring only 11 species instead of 35 to describe
                DMM sub-chemistry. The obtained lumped kinetic model was then
                improved through a data-driven optimization procedure, targeting
                data artificially generated by the reference detailed mechanism.
                The optimization was performed on the physically-constrained
                parameters of the modified-Arrhenius rate constants of the
                controlling reaction steps, identified via local sensitivity
                analyses. The dissimilarities between the predictions of the
                detailed and lumped models were minimized using a Curve Matching
                objective function for a comprehensive and quantitative
                characterization. Above all, the optimized mechanism was found to
                behave comparably to the starting detailed one, throughout most
                of the operating space and target properties (ignition delay
                times in shock tubes, laminar flame speeds, and speciations in
                stirred and flow reactors). The successful application of the
                proposed methodology to the DMM chemistry paves the way for its
                extensive use in the kinetic modeling of longer OMEs as well as
                heavier fuels, for which the computational advantages are
                expected to be even higher.},

                div class="htmlview paragraph"{\textgreater}In the rapidly
                changing scenario of the energy transition, data-driven tools for
                kinetic mechanism development and testing can greatly support the
                evaluation of the combustion properties of new potential e-fuels.
                Despite the effectiveness of kinetic mechanism generation and
                optimization procedures and the increased availability of
                experimental data, integrated methodologies combining data
                analysis, kinetic simulations, chemical lumping, and kinetic
                mechanism optimization are still lacking. This paper presents an
                integrated workflow that combines recently developed automated
                tools for kinetic mechanism development and testing, from data
                collection to kinetic model reduction and optimization. The
                proposed methodology is applied to build a consistent, efficient,
                and well-performing kinetic mechanism for the combustion of
                oxymethylene ethers (OMEs), which are promising synthetic e-fuels
                for transportation. In fact, OMEs are easily mixed with
                conventional fuels and share similar ignition propensity, and are
                therefore potential drop-in fuels. Additionally, their oxygenated
                nature significantly reduces soot emissions. The proposed
                workflow extends our recently developed kinetic mechanism for
                OME$_{\textrm{1}}$ (dimethoxymethane â€“ DMM) to OME$_{\textrm{2-4}
                }$: the model is derived from state-of-the-art detailed
                literature mechanisms, updated according to a reaction
                class-based approach, and simplified according to chemical
                lumping. Then, the model is reduced to two different skeletal
                versions using DRGEP method. An extensive database of {
                \textasciitilde}80 datasets for kinetic mechanism testing is
                collected, covering different reactor types and experimental
                conditions. The selected datasets are uploaded to SciExpeM, a
                recently developed data ecosystem that allows automated kinetic
                mechanism performance evaluation through a multi-index approach.
                The performance obtained from SciExpeM shows that the lumped
                mechanism reproduces well the selected experimental data, and
                both skeletal mechanisms, well-suited to CFD and engine
                simulations, show equally good performance. Some minor model
                deficiencies identified for OME$_{\textrm{2}}$ and OME$_{\textrm{
                3}}$ are finally recovered via data-driven kinetic modeling
                optimization, which relies on the same multi-index approach
                adopted in SciExpeM for the kinetic model evaluation.{\textless}
