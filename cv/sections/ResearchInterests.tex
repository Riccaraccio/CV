I am in my third year of Ph.D. at \polimi, affiliated with the Department of
Chemistry, Materials, and Chemical Engineering Giulio Natta. My research takes place
within the CRECK modeling laboratory, under the supervision of Professor Alessandro
Stagni. My Ph.D. work centers on enhancing chemical kinetics models for predicting
combustion and pyrolysis behaviors of complex fuels using data-driven methods.
My academic pursuits revolve around the following areas of interest:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Developing and overseeing an automatic framework (SciExpeM) to systematically
      gather and analyze scientific data and kinetic models.

   \item Creating robust pipelines to develop and validate detailed kinetic models.
      Models undergoing rigorous testing against extensive experimental datasets using
      data science methodologies.

   \item Designing automated routines to simplify the optimization of complex kinetic
      schemes, thus boosting the effectiveness of physics-based approaches.

   \item Implementing algorithms for the inverse modeling of high-dimensional problems,
      with the goal of improving predictive capabilities in complex systems.
\end{itemize}
