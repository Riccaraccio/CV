I am a second-year Ph.D. student at Politecnico di Milano, affiliated with the Department of Chemistry, Materials, and Chemical Engineering "Giulio Natta". My research is conducted within the CRECK Modeling Laboratory, under the supervision of Professor Tiziano Faravelli and Professor Matteo Pelucchi. My primary research focus is on developing a particle-scale CFD model for the pyrolysis and combustion of biomass and porous media in a broader sense. Additionally, I am involved in the development of solid-phase kinetic mechanisms.
