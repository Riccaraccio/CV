\section{\sc Research Interests}
% I am a third year Ph.D. student at Politecnico di Milano, in the Department of Chemistry,
% Materials and Chemical Engineering Giulio Natta, within the CRECK modeling laboratory,
% under the supervision of Prof. Alessandro Stagni. My research activity focuses on the
% application of data-driven methods to promote the development of chemical kinetics
% mechanisms for the prediction of combustion and pyrolysis of complex fuels. Overall the
% main interests are:
%
% \begin{itemize}
%    \item Developing and maintaining an automatic framework for the
%       collection and analysis of scientific data and kinetic models
%       (\href{https://sciexpem.polimi.it/}{SciExpeM}).
%
%    \item Build reliable pipelines for developing and validating detailed kinetic
%       mechanisms against large numbers of experimental measurements using data science
%       techniques.
%
%    \item Developing automatic routine for optimizing complex kinetic schemes empwering physics-based approaches.
%
%    \item Apply different algorithms for the inverse modeling of high dimensional problems.
% \end{itemize}
