Most of the contributions can be found at \href{https://github.com/tdinelli}{https://github.com/tdinelli}. During my PhD, together with Edoardo Ramalli, I was the main developer and actual maintainer of the \href{https://sciexpem.polimi.it/}{SciExpeM} ecosystem, which integrates and orchestrates various programs and software. I have actively contributed to the development of \href{https://www.opensmokepp.polimi.it/}{OpenSMOKE++}. My contributions include significant enhancements to the core library, as well as the development of functionality for the ideal reactor and one-dimensional flame solvers, \href{https://www.opensmokepp.polimi.it/}{DoctorSMOKE++} and \href{https://github.com/burn-research/OptiSMOKE_toolbox}{OptiSMOKE++}. I have developed a Python interface, \href{https://github.com/tdinelli/OpenSMOKEpp_Interfaces}{OpenSMOKEpp\_Intrefaces}, which exposes the core functionality of the {\tt OpenSMOKE++} library. In addition, I have created a comprehensive post-processing suite, \href{https://github.com/tdinelli/pySMOKEPostProcessor}{pySMOKEPostProcessor}. Currently I am working on the development of the \texttt{CurveMatching} framework, which is tailored for functional data analysis, with a special focus on chemical kinetic data.
