{\bf Software---}
I have extensive experience in developing and maintaining scientific computing software across multiple domains. As an active contributor to \href{https://www.opensmokepp.polimi.it/}{OpenSMOKE++}, I've specialized in implementing solid-phase chemistry core functionalities. My work includes developing and maintaining both 0-D and 1-D solvers that integrate with OpenSMOKE++ for solid-phase systems analysis. I have worked on the development of solid-phase reaction kinetic mechanisms. Additionally, I have over a year of experience developing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code using the \href{www.basilisk.fr}{Basilisk} framework. Most of my contributions can be found on my GitHub profile at \href{https://github.com/Riccaraccio}{https://github.com/Riccaraccio}.
