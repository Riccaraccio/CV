{\bf Software---}%
Most contributions can be found at \url{https://github.com/tdinelli}. During my PhD I have
been, together with Edoardo Ramalli, the main developer and actual mantainer of the
\href{https://sciexpem.polimi.it/}{SciExpeM} ecosystem, which involves and orchestrates
different programs and software. I actively contributed to the development of
\href{https://www.opensmokepp.polimi.it/}{OpenSMOKE++} ecosystem. My contributions include
significant enhancements to the core library, as well as the development of
functionalities for the ideal reactor and one-dimensional flame solvers, {\tt
DoctorSMOKEpp}, and the creation of
\href{https://github.com/burn-research/OptiSMOKE_toolbox}{OptiSMOKEpp}. I have developed a
python interface,
\href{https://github.com/tdinelli/OpenSMOKEpp_Interfaces}{OpenSMOKEpp\_Intrefaces}, which
exposes the key functionalities of the core {\tt OpenSMOKEpp} library. Additionally I have
created comprehensive post-processing suite,
\href{https://github.com/tdinelli/pySMOKEPostProcessor}{pySMOKEPostProcessor}. Presently,
I am engaged in the development of the \texttt{CurveMatching} framework, which is tailored
towards functional data analysis, with a specific emphasis on chemical kinetic data.

% Furthermore, I am working on \texttt{daSMOKE}, a collection of Data Assimilation routines
% designed to address the joint state parameters estimation problem within chemical kinetic
% dynamical systems.
