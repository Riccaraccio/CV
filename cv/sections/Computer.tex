Most of the contributions can be found at
\href{https://github.com/tdinelli}{https://github.com/tdinelli}. During my PhD, together
with Edoardo Ramalli, I was the main developer and actual maintainer of the
\href{https://sciexpem.polimi.it/}{SciExpeM} ecosystem, which integrates and orchestrates
various programs and software. I have actively contributed to the development of
\href{https://www.opensmokepp.polimi.it/}{OpenSMOKE++}. My contributions include
significant enhancements to the core library, as well as the development of functionality
for the ideal reactor and one-dimensional flame solvers,
\href{https://www.opensmokepp.polimi.it/}{DoctorSMOKE++} and
\href{https://github.com/burn-research/OptiSMOKE_toolbox}{OptiSMOKE++}. I have developed a
Python interface,
\href{https://github.com/tdinelli/OpenSMOKEpp_Interfaces}{OpenSMOKEpp\_Intrefaces}, which
exposes the core functionality of the {\tt OpenSMOKE++} library. In addition, I have
created a comprehensive post-processing suite,
\href{https://github.com/tdinelli/pySMOKEPostProcessor}{pySMOKEPostProcessor}. Currently I
am working on the development of the \texttt{CurveMatching} framework, which is tailored
for functional data analysis, with a special focus on chemical kinetic data.
